### Description
This is my weather app called WeatherNow, which was created with a free api. Because I don't use it, anyone can create it's own based on this. (Like a template) Feel free to reuse it!

### Installation
1. Clone/Fork this repository. 2. Rebrand it (Change the pictures, the signs, etc.) 3. Set up your api(index.html 3rd row: var apikey = "INSERT HERE") 4. Change the card texts based on the response from the api.

### Usage
Use it as you want, this is just a template, but could you star it?

### Contribution
It's a template, so unfortunately you cannot contribute to this project, but install it and use it yourself.
